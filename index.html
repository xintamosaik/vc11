        <!-- SUMMARY-->

        <section id="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Outcome-oriented Web Developer with a strong focus on simplifying
                complex systems, enabling team alignment, and driving practical
                improvements — even in ambiguous, fast-moving environments.
                Experienced in modern TypeScript-based development, internal tooling,
                and migrating legacy systems toward maintainable, observable, and
                testable architectures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I care about process, collaboration, and long-term value. Colleagues
                appreciate my initiative, low-ego mentoring, and ability to spot
                structural issues early — but I wait for readiness and co-shape
                change, rather than forcing it. Whether building template tooling that
                cut development loops from minutes to seconds or quietly replacing
                thousands of fragile lines with 60 that just work, I bring options —
                and make change easier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now growing further into team-enabling roles through better listening,
                architecture clarity, and servant-leader practices.

                            <strong>Built the SkyMover system</strong> to unify ad
                            positioning logic across 40+ client websites — replaced hundreds
                            of scattered, error-prone layout scripts with a 100-line JS
                            module, significantly reducing technical debt and enabling
                            faster, observable integration across legacy systems.

                            <strong>Architected and delivered a modern ad template
                                builder</strong>
                            using TypeScript and esbuild — replaced a fragile, manual system
                            with import/export support, modular design, and a local test
                            environment. Reduced feedback loop time from 3-5 minutes to
                            under 1 second, enabling rapid iteration and future testing
                            capabilities.

                            <strong>Reverse-engineered and replaced a 5,000-line legacy
                                AdController</strong>
                            with a ~60-line config-driven core — restored control over
                            deployment, removed reliance on third-party TMS, enabled
                            versioning, and laid the foundation for CI/CD and
                            TypeScript-based development across ad tech infrastructure.

                            <strong>Created internal DX tools</strong> including a test
                            harness for templates, a URL builder to streamline QA workflows,
                            and macro validation logic — significantly improved developer
                            efficiency, reduced context-switching, and accelerated the
                            migration of legacy templates.

                            by introducing TypeScript, ESLint, JSdoc, domain-based folder
                            structures, and fast-feedback mindsets. Mentored junior
                            teammates, led pair programming efforts, and helped reshape
                            quality habits within a historically chaotic delivery
                            environment.

                            React/Chrome APIs support and shifted the team toward
                            servant-leader dynamics through ego-suppressed mentoring.

                        into a modular WordPress plugin (q_invoice) using MVC
                        architecture, domain/feature slicing, AJAX-based UX, and modern
                        PHP practices. Achieved full feature parity in ~7 months,
                        introduced multi-language support, custom tax handling,
                        import/export logic, and reduced friction for business

                    <li>
                        <strong>Designed and implemented a flexible internal reporting
                            system</strong>
                        (PHP + Chart.js) that enabled visual filtering across event types,
                        cities, and date ranges — a key decision-making tool praised by
                        the CEO for its usability and depth. Architected for
                        extensibility, with lazy AJAX rendering and data-driven config
                        logic.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Reduced noise and instability in the admin panel</strong>

                        warnings. Introduced a lightweight logging system with trace
                        capabilities, restoring error log usability and giving the team
                        visibility into regressions.

                        <strong>Refactored scattered legacy code</strong> (PHP/JS) into
                        modular components with clear boundaries — cutting bug rates by
                        ~40% in key workflows and improving overall developer confidence
                        and responsiveness.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Took initiative to drive peer mentoring</strong> and code
                        quality practices in a chaotic, process-light environment:
                        introduced Discord-based pair programming sessions, launched
                        informal review habits, and promoted better naming, structure, and
                        JS/PHP linting across the team.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Introduced WP_React, JSdoc, ESLint, and static PHP analysis
                            tools</strong>
                        to strengthen reliability and readability. Drove early Docker
                        adoption to enable testability, though the team was not yet ready
                        for full TDD.
